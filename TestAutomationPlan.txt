Purpose: prepare test scenarios to test API of petstore.swagger.io side.
Test approach: Test Scenarios - positive/negative cases, Selenium scenarios.
Tools: Java 17 (because current project should be migrated to Java 17 and nice to have it now)
       TestNG - easy to manage suite scenarios, run it in order, parallel, using test data, etc. (Familiar to me :) )
       Rest Assured API framework (+json).
       Intellij IDEA.
       log4j - log to console and file.
       git.
 Deadline: 3-5 days
 Risks: match deadline to cover all combination scenarios and selenium.

 Scope scenarios:
 pet:
  - uploadImage +
  - create pet +
  - update pet +
  - findByStatus +
  - findById +
  - update in store +
  - delete pet +
  - find by tag - deprecated - skip now
 store:
  - inventory
  - new order +
  - find by orderId +
  - delete by OrderId +
 user:
  - create with list +
  - get by name +
  - update user
  - delete user +
  - login +
  - logout +
  - createWithArray - similar to previous one: List
  - create user +

Example end to end scenario (my vision - need to discuss with business):
create pet
update pet
upload image
new user
login
findByStatus
new order
update in store - pending
update in store - sold
find by orderId
logout

Automation Requirements/Notes:
- Each case is in separate class to have clear vision what type of scenario is fail (to discuss). Some of them contains data_provider just to show how it possible to use.
- Each case should be independent to each others.
- Check only Status Code to success/fail - TODO add messages/headers verification
- add positive (the first) and negative cases - TODO
- WA to fix an issue to have response (see PetVerifier class) - send request a few time to get correct response (need to discuss the issue)
- cover Rest API as low automation level to find and fix all possible issues early. Then next is GUI (via Selenium).
- TestListener to show log for start/end case.
